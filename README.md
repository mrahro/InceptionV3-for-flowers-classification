# InceptionV3-for-flowers-classification

In this project we will fine-tune InceptionV3 architecture for flowers classification.
Flowers classification dataset (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) consists of 102 flower categories commonly occurring in the United Kingdom. Each class contains between 40 and 258 images.

We take the following steps:
- preparing images for the model
- implementing batch generator
- fine-tuning the pre-trained model
